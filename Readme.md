# Real-time Event Engagement Platform

This project is a simplified version of a real-time event engagement platform, demonstrating full-stack coordination and real-time communication. Users can browse upcoming events, join them, and instantly see a live list of other attendees via WebSocket updates.

## üöÄ Features

* **Event Listing**: View a list of available events.

* **Event Details**: See details for a specific event, including current attendees.

* **Join Event**: Users can join an event.

* **Real-time Attendee Updates**: Instantly see new attendees join an event without refreshing, powered by WebSockets.

* **Mock Authentication**: A basic login system for user identification.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Backend

* **Node.js**: JavaScript runtime.

* **GraphQL**: API query language (with Apollo Server).

* **Prisma**: Next-generation ORM for Node.js and TypeScript.

* **PostgreSQL**: Relational database.

* **Socket.io**: Real-time bidirectional event-based communication.

* **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript.

### Frontend

* **React Native (Expo)**: Framework for building cross-platform mobile applications.

* **TanStack Query**: Data fetching and caching for React.

* **Zustand**: A small, fast, and scalable bearbones state-management solution.

* **Apollo Client**: GraphQL client for React.

* **Socket.io Client**: For real-time communication with the backend.

* **TypeScript**: Strongly typed JavaScript.

## üíª Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

* **Node.js**: v18 or higher (includes npm)

  * [Download Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)

* **PostgreSQL**: Database server

  * [Download PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/download/)

* **Expo CLI**:

  ```
  npm install -g expo-cli
  ```

* **Git**: For cloning the repository.

  * [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## üì¶ Installation & Setup

Follow these steps to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### 1. Database Setup (PostgreSQL)

Ensure your PostgreSQL server is running. You'll need to create a database for this application. For example, you can create a database named `eventplatform_db`.

* **Using `psql`:**

  ```
  psql -U your_postgres_user
  CREATE DATABASE eventplatform_db;
  \q
  ```

* Make sure you update your database connection string in the `.env` file (which you'll create in the backend setup).

### 2. Backend Setup

The backend code assumes a directory structure like `backend/src/...` or directly in the project root if it's a monorepo. For simplicity, assume the backend code provided in the previous turn is in a `backend` directory.

1. **Navigate to the backend directory**:

   ```
   cd backend
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. **Create `.env` file**: In the `backend` directory, create a `.env` file and add your PostgreSQL connection string. Replace `your_postgres_user`, `your_postgres_password`, `your_postgres_host`, and `your_postgres_port` with your actual PostgreSQL credentials.

   ```
   DATABASE_URL="postgresql://your_postgres_user:your_postgres_password@your_postgres_host:your_postgres_port/eventplatform_db?schema=public"
   PORT=4000
   ```

4. **Run Prisma Migrations**: This will create the necessary tables in your PostgreSQL database based on `prisma/schema.prisma`.

   ```
   npx prisma migrate dev --name init
   ```

### 3. Frontend Setup

1. **Navigate to the frontend directory**:

   ```
   cd MyEventApp
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```
   npm install
   ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run the Application

### 1. Start the Backend

Make sure you are in the `backend` directory.

```
npm start
```

You should see output indicating that the GraphQL server is running on `http://localhost:4000` and the Socket.io server on `http://localhost:4001`.

### 2. Start the Frontend

Open a **new terminal window** and navigate to the `MyEventApp` directory.

```
npx expo start
```

This will open the Expo Dev Tools in your browser. You can then:

* Scan the QR code with the **Expo Go** app on your physical device.

* Press `a` to run on an Android emulator.

* Press `i` to run on an iOS simulator.

* Press `w` to run in a web browser (some features might be limited compared to native).

## üîë Example Credentials (Mocked Login)

For the mocked authentication system, you can use the following credentials to log in:

* **Email**: `test@example.com`

* **Password**: `password`

Upon successful login, a mock token is generated, and you'll be redirected to the event list.

## üöÄ Usage

1. **Login**: Use the provided example credentials on the login screen.

2. **Browse Events**: After logging in, you will see a list of available events.

3. **View Event Details**: Tap on any event to see its details, including its location, time, and a list of current attendees.

4. **Join Event**: On the event detail page, if you haven't already joined, you'll see a "Join Event" button. Tap it to join.

5. **Real-time Updates**: To observe real-time updates, open the app on two different devices/simulators and navigate to the same event detail page. When one user joins the event, the attendee list will instantly update on both screens.
